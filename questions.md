# Questions

## Home Page

1. Color of navbar (ie it will run over stuff and probably not be visible)
2. Font scaling (for different things)
3. Loading animations... this page is getting a bit heavy and it seems like some of the videos might not be loaded in time (low priority)
4. Build Biology Fonts (DONE)
5. Build Biology videos
6. Run through spacing / compatability
    Video Width vs Height (overall, which is priority esp for smaller screens)

## Navigation

1. What do you want it to look like? IE How to organize the pages
2. Brown red logo over black is weird
